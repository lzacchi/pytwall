# pytwall

## Python API to fetch Formula 1 telemetry data through Ergast API and FastF1

### Why the name?
The pit wall is a trackside station filled with computers where race engineers visualize and analyze data streamed from Formula 1 cars. I added a 'y' because it's Python and I'm bad at names.
